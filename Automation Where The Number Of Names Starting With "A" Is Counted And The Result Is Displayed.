PRACTICAL 5
Consider An Array Of Names. We Have To Find Out How Many Of Them Start With
The Letter "A". Create An Automation Where The Number Of Names Starting With
"A" Is Counted And The Result Is Displayed.
Process steps :
1. Add sequence activity in the designer panel.
2. Create variables with name names and count respectively in the variable panel. The
variable type for
names is Array of T[] along with String data type and count variable with Int32. And Scope
as Sequence
for both variables.
3. Add For Each activity, assign For Each items in the Names variable. Within the body of
For Each activity
add If activity, with the condition of ‘items.ToString.StartWith(“R”)’. If there is any name
that starts with
the letter ‘R’(case sensitive) then it will go to Then block part of If activity.
4. In Then block add Assign activity and assign the ‘count’ variable to ‘count+1 ‘. The count
will be
incremented when there is more than one name starting with the letter ‘R’.
5. Outside the For Each activity add Message Box activity. Add Text as ‘count+” names
available that start
with ‘R’. it will showcase items starting with the letter ’R’.

6. Run the process using the Run Button.
