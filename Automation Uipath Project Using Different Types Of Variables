PRACTICAL 2B
Create An Automation Uipath Project Using Different Types Of Variables. (Number,
Datetime, Boolean, Generic, Array, Data Table)
1. BOOLEAN


2.GENERIC

3.ARRAY
Array variable
Process step:
1. Search for Sequence Activity, drag and drop Sequence activity added in the designer panel.
2. Inside the variable panel create a variable currentItem with Variable Type String Type,
Scope as the sequence.
3. Add For each activity inside the sequence. Enter the variable that you want to print in the
body to ForEach
part assign variable currentItem inside the in part.
4. Add a Message Box activity in the body of Each activity. Enter text as “the names are” +
currentItem
5. Use Run Button to run the process. it will print all elements inside the array.
4.NUMBERS
Process Steps:
1. Create age and name variables inside the variable panel. Age variable with Type Int32,
Scope as
sequence, and the name variable with Type String, scope as Sequence.
2. Add Sequence activity inside the designer panel.
3. Add two Input Dialog activities inside the Sequence for the person name and age
respectively. Give
Input Title as “person details”. Input Lable as “ Enter your name: “ and “Enter your age: “
always in
double-quotes. Select Input Type as “TextBox” and value entered enter the variables name
created in
the variable panel as name and age respectively.
4. Add Message Box activity after that and add Text as “ Your name is “+name+ “ and age is
”+age.ToString+” .“.
5. Run the process using Run Button.
5.DATATABLE
1. Create variables inside the variable panel with the name TableData and result. With
Variable type for
TableData “DataTable” and “String” respectively. Variable scope is Sequence for both the
variables.
2. Add Sequence activity in the designer panel.
3. Add Data Table activity inside Sequence add Colum in it as names and age add some data
in it.
4. Add Output Data Table activity after Data Table activity adds Tabledata variable in the
input of output data table and result variable in output part of the output data table.
5. Add Message Box activity after the Output Data Table. In Text add a result variable to
print data stored
in it.
6. Run the process using the Run button.
6.DATETIME
1. Add Sequence activity in designer panel.
2. Create variable name variable1 with Variable type System.DateTime, and Scope Sequence.
3. Add assign activity, inside sequence activity . Assign Now() to variable variable1 this will
take system
current date and time and store into variable1.
4. Add Message Box activity after assign activity, add Text ‘variable1.ToLongDateString+ “,
“+
variable1.ToLongTimeString’.
5. Run the process by clicking run button.
